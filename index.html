                    <h3>Kayano30: Protection and Stability</h3>
                        <p>From 5Ks to full marathons, the GEL-KAYANO® 30 shoe is designed to provide advanced stability 
                            and softer cushioning properties. ​​The new 4D GUIDANCE SYSTEM™ helps provide adaptive stability. 
                            This helps you experience a more supportive and balanced stride during your distance training.</p> 
                            
                        <p>Its midsole is revamped with FF BLAST™ PLUS ECO cushioning and a 4mm stack height increase. 
                            With approximately 20% bio-based content, this material helps create cloud-like softness in every step</p> 
                        
                        <p>The new PureGEL® technology is strategically positioned below the heel for a smoother ride. It's 65% softer 
                            than conventional visible GEL® technology, allowing your distance training to feel surprisingly smooth.</p>

                        <h3>Nimbus26: Cushion and Comfort</h3>
                        <p>The GEL-NIMBUS™ 26 PLATINUM shoe's soft cushioning properties help you feel like you're landing on clouds. 
                            This design is revamped to help create a softer and smoother running experience.A soft engineered knit 
                            upper comfortably wraps your foot while supplying advanced ventilation. Additionally, the knit tongue 
                            and collar help provide a soft and supportive feel.</p>   
                        
                        <p>By using FF BLAST™ PLUS ECO cushioning, this trainer creates a lighter and softer cushioning experience 
                            with less of an impact on the environment.Lastly, HYBRID ASICSGRIP™ outsole rubber helps create better 
                            traction, improved softness, and advanced durability.</p>

                    <h3>Kayano14: The OG shoes</h3>
                            <p>The GEL-KAYANO® 14 running shoe resurfaces with its late 2000s aesthetic as a nod to our storied 
                                GEL-KAYANO® series. Reinterpreting the shoe's performance capabilities with updated materials 
                                and componentry, this version became the first iteration in the sneaker's lineage to be designed 
                                by someone other than Toshikazu Kayano. Mirroring the original midsole tooling with 
                                GEL® technology cushioning, this shoe also improves the fit of the upper while retaining its 
                                layered leather and mesh construction from 2008.</p>

                    <h3>Gel-1130: The retro shoes</h3>
                            <p>Spanning across decades of design evolution, the GEL-1130™ sneaker pays homage to the ninth iteration 
                                of the GEL-1000™ series. The stability running shoe from 2008 keeps you feeling supported wherever your mind takes you.</p> 
                                
                            <p>Additionally, this retro runner’s comfort is remixed for the streets, featuring GEL™ technology in the 
                                heel for lasting comfort.</p>

                    <h3>Gel-NYC: The inspiration shoes</h3>
                            <p>The GEL-NYC™ sneaker sources inspiration from heritage and modern performance running styles.​</p>
                            
                            <p>Its upper construction references the GEL-NIMBUS® 3 shoe from the early 2000s and blends it with 
                                various embellishments from the GEL-MC PLUS™ V design.​</p>

                            <p>The tooling contrasts the upper's retro influences by using the GEL-CUMULUS® 16 shoe's tooling system. Through a 
                                combination of lightweight foams and GEL® technology inserts, this midsole formation helps create advanced 
                                underfoot comfort.</p>
